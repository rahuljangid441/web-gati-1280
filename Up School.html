                        Across the large and populous State of Uttar Pradesh, there are over 25 million children, a number higher than that in many countries, globally. To educate them, the State is already home to the maximum  number of schools in the country.<br><br> The Government has been trying to bring the schools close to the children and to ensure that no child is deprived of education.  School enrolment rates have also risen over the last few years. But, there are still unserved areas that need more schools to be built so that children

                        in those locations are not left out of the path to literacy and progress,  especially when they reach high school. Armed with their heavy school bags and without proper road infrastructure, some of the children today have to travel long distances in difficult conditions today to reach their schools.
 
                        Solving for this is a mammoth task given the sheer numbers and the far-reaching social impact it can drive. The PAHUNCH tool is a decision support system to assess unserved habitations that need secondary and senior secondary schools.

                        As a starting point in this project, all the schools (Secondary and Senior Secondary) of UP board, CBSE  & ICSE Board were mapped on a separate layer on the PM GatiShakti State Master Plan (SMP) platform.
                        The key attributes of schools were mapped ranging from power availability to road connectivity to internet access. 
                        The journey of a young kid, maybe a girl, whose parents are afraid of sending their daughter to a far off school and who cannot afford a private school which is relatively closer, guided the user-centric understanding  for the

                         project. The user mapping could be executed based on existing habitation and the number of families above a threshold level where schools and other amenities were needed  if they did not exist. This was the thinking and the planning process behind the schools that were proposed by the department using this tool. This honoured the  sentiment that if the child cannot make it to the school, the school must reach the child. Using geospatial data, buffer zones could be created as per the requirements.

                        With this intelligence, the unserved areas could be mapped out systematically and efficiently.
                        Along with this, the granular availability of neighbouring infrastructure such as roads, hospitals, police stations,
                        and power lines could also be assessed in a single snapshot.

                        This enabled actionable insights for decision-making by displaying key distances, routes and unserved village names.

                 <p>
                    The Samagra Shiksha Annual Work Plan 2023-2024 in the state has been prepared based on the PAHUNCH tool.
                    Using the actionable insights from the portal, the Department has proposed the new High School and Intermediate Colleges in the unserved habitations. Bringing further efficiency in the process, the plan has also been submitted to Govt. of India for approval through the PAHUNCH Portal.<br><br>
                    A total of 107 High Schools and 92 Intermediate Colleges were proposed, out of which 78 high schools and 19 senior secondary schools have been sanctioned for the year 2023-24, ensuring that there is a high school in a 3 km (1.8 miles) radius of every village and a senior secondary school exists in the radius of 5 km (3.1 miles). 
                    This was made possible due to the GatiShakti portal, which helped the state reach its goal of enabling every child to access education. This exercise will benefit an additional 20,000 students of Uttar Pradesh in 2023-24.
