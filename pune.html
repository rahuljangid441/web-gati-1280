                The planned expressway between the bustling and modern cities of Bengaluru and Pune traverses 14 vibrant industrial and economic corridors, including automobile and white goods factories, pharmaceutical, textile, food and manufacturing clusters, special economic zones and the defence corridor of Karnataka and Maharashtra.<br><br>
                The expressway needs to serve these clusters' evolving economic and social needs. This involves the movement of raw materials and freight serving the industrial areas, agricultural output reaching the consumers, labour mobility, tourist movement and distribution from the ports for exports.

                Material from mega food parks of Bijapur, Tumkuru, Sangli, Satara, electronic manufacturing clusters of Bengaluru, medical supplies from healthcare and pharmaceutical clusters in Baramati, Pune, Bengaluru, silk textiles from Karnataka, cotton threads from Maharashtra - all need to reach different locations across the country for creating the finished goods which can be used by domestic and global consumers.<br><br>
                The interconnected nature of the project drives seamless and unrestricted movement in southern and western India by connecting with 15 National and 25 State highways, 6 railway stations and 70 current and planned waterway nodes.

                        The proposed rail alignment is between Bhadrak, a picturesque tourist attraction district in Odisha,and Vizianagaram, a historical city in Southern India, which have today emerged into modern commercial zones. 
                        Odisha is home to the country's second-largest coal reserves, with high demand in India across some Southern 
                        States and for exports.The rail alignment would reduce congestion in the existing burdened railway and port<br>
                        network and ease freight movement, providing an alternate route for coal and other minerals such as iron ore and steel from the ports to the domestic and global markets. The project is crucial for the movement of raw materials and cargo between India's southern and eastern coasts.

                        their expansion plans. It would help in seamless transportation from goods sheds and increase domestic 
                        coal transport and coastal connectivity. This, in turn, would reduce logistics transportation costs. 
                        Beyond connectivity between major east coast ports, the proposed broad gauge railway line will also 
                        connect major cities in Bhadrak, Odisha, and Vizianagaram, Andhra Pradesh.It will enable seamless<br>
                        cargo movement between India's eastern and southern coast through rail-sea-rail movement.<br>
                        It will catalyse the progress and development of the region while bringing seamless connectivity.

                        The initially prepared alignment, done without using the PM GatiShakti NMP platform lacked information due to the unavailability of data regarding the clearances required, connectivity to economic nodes, etc., which could have resulted in issues with clearances and consequent delays.<br><br> A revised alignment was created using the NMP platform, which helped assess all nearby economic activities and connectivity points - automobile and manufacturing hubs, textile clusters, eco-sensitive areas, and railway linkages, in addition to access to National and State highways and waterways.
                        <br><br>

                         periphery would not just connect additional economic nodes 
                        but also link to additional National Highways. The path traversed would ease the Right of Way (RoW), reducing forest cover and connecting industrial clusters.<br><br>

                        To reduce the ecological impact of the project overlaps with existing infrastructure and geographical features such as forests and mines were assessed on the portal. The alignment modifications in areas such as Bagalkote, Tumkuru district, Karnataka, using the digital data layers of GatiShakti, helped reduce forest area overlap by 19%.<br><br>
                        The proposed alignment not only decreases distance and travel time but also prioritizes ecological considerations, resulting in a reduced carbon footprint.

                        In terms of allied infrastructure, the multi-layer data on the portal enabled planning of a 2m Right of Way for a dedicated utility corridor. Manual survey time was reduced by complementing the digital survey of land records available on NMP.

                        The massive project required multiple clearances across forest cover, transmission lines, railways, and more. The GIS-based planning allowed for seamless and fast clearances across departments as well as utility shiftings.<br><br>There were 90 no-objection certificates required in Maharashtra and 110 in Karnataka across over 12 districts. 190 power and telecommunication utilities have been shifted across the 2 States, all of which was made easier with GatiShakti led planning.

                <p>
                    Apart from the multimodal connectivity and the social and economic benefits, there would be massive fuel savings from the project due to the travel length and travel time reduction. While the overall length is reduced, the average speed would increase to 80-100 kmph, providing a reduction in travel time of about 7-8 hours from the 12 hours it presently takes. This would lead to about 39 crore (390 million) kg CO2 reduction with about 16 crore (160 million) litres of fuel savings annually.<br><br>
The project is expected to provide 71 lakh (7.1 million) person days of direct and indirect employment.
