                <p>Infrastructure is the barometer for enabling manufacturing and logistics competitiveness, building social connectivity and driving the economic growth of a nation. 
                    Today, as India stands at the cusp of its journey towards a century of independence, infrastructure is accelerating the roadmap to our vision of becoming Viksit Bharat (developed India).</p>
                    <div class="highlighted_txt">
                        <p> The Government of India has committed a <b id="color_txt">historic capital expenditure</b> outlay across multiple infrastructural assets, including roads, railways, ports, telecommunication, power, renewable energy and more. India's diversity and scale calls for an integrated approach to bring both ease of living for our citizens and ease of doing business within the country and internationally. To support the underlying logistics ecosystem and leapfrog our manufacturing efficiency, efforts are being made to bring down the time and cost of planning and implementation of these projects.  
                    
                            PM GatiShakti is radically transforming the approach to <b id="color_txt">integrated planning</b> for <b id="color_txt">multimodal infrastructure connectivity</b> that is boosting Indiaâ€™s socio-economic growth. Launched in October 2021,  PM GatiShakti is anchored on 2 levers:

                        The GIS data-backed platform (NMP) maps  out all infrastructural assets of our social and economic Ministries and Departments. This detailed mapping enables one with granular visibility of roads, railways, ports, railway stations, natural resources, forest areas, mining areas, power lines, optical fibre cables, telecom lines etc., as a single view.
                        With this platform, the planning process and ability to visualise and implement multimodal connections boils down to the click of a button. The collaborations and clearances required from multiple Ministries and Departments are also simplified under the PM GatiShakti approach. This entire process is enabled by the Network Planning Groups (NPG) operating under  PM GatiShakti. The Group helps to navigate the complex and interconnected workflows across teams and also to plan the required prioritizations at a strategic level. 
                        For example, if a new expressway is being planned using the PM GatiShakti platform, the concerned Ministry can visualise the exact terrain, assess the industrial parks and manufacturing clusters, and identify the forest land, the inland waterways and the railway tracks. This also streamlines collaboration across other ministries, from Coal to Steel to Mining, etc., for comprehensive planning at scale.
                        Meanwhile, for a clean energy plant in the mountainous region of Ladakh where solar power is being harvested, generated and brought all the way to the heart of the nation, PM GatiShakti helped plan the distribution line using the GIS-based technology.

                     <span>
                         This involved route alignment, minimising intersections with sensitive areas such as forests, identifying the need to build additional roads, estimating the need for new bridge construction, and assessing the movement of oversized cargo. It also streamlined and simplified collaboration across relevant ministries/departments.
                        The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan (NMP) is also being used to plan innovative social infrastructure projects that can deliver much-needed services to local communities. For example, states are using the National Master Plan's multi-level data mapping to plan new schools in remote areas, which can increase access to the key amenities people need.
                        Be it economic or social infrastructure, PM GatiShakti is enabling first and last-mile connectivity. It also enables better sustainability by reducing the carbon footprint and driving traffic away from congested roads as needed to waterways, railways, and other modes of transport.
                        The platform helps in minimizing duplication or blocking of existing infrastructure and drives optimal alignments that reduce both route distances and travel time, simplifying the approvals needed. By highlighting the gaps in infrastructural and social connectivity, the investment for each Ministry is well-guided and helps plan for the right interventions based on hard data.
                        Overall, the PM GatiShakti enables a holistic area-based  development for comprehensive socio-economic growth.

                        PM GatiShakti is an approach that enables <span id="color_txt">accurate data-backed decision-making</span> with its comprehensive and multi-layers of data. These layers can be combined on the GIS map to undertake digital surveys that are revolutionising the infrastructure planning process. This is helping with a drastic reduction of time for field surveys and also shortening overall project timelines.<br><br>
                        With <span id="color_txt">full visibility </span>of all the points of connectivity, it de-risks investments in new infrastructure. The overall governance of multimillion-dollar infrastructure projects becomes simpler as project planning risks reduce, and each project can comprehensively enable both economic and social connectivity, thereby driving ease of living and <span id="color_txt">ease of doing business</span>.<br><br>
                        For example, over the last 2 years, over 7,000 kms (4,350 miles) of expressways have been planned using this approach, with the GIS-enabled digital surveys drastically reducing the time for field surveys. In the year 2022-23, final location surveys (FLS) necessary for establishing new railway lines were undertaken for more than 400 projects, a significant increase from just 57 projects in the previous year. It also resulted in planning a staggering 13,500 km (8,389 miles)

                        of railway lines using this approach, which goes to show the sheer scale of planning PM GatiShakti can enable.<br><br>
                        Meanwhile, in the case of laying a petroleum and natural gas pipeline, a detailed manual survey used to take over 6-9 months to prepare, comprising multiple reports. However, with the PM GatiShakti platform, all of this can now be done in just a few hours, as all the relevant information is available on a single platform.<br> <br>
                        At the planning stage on the PM GatiShakti portal, the infrastructure projects are also demonstrating a strong commitment to the environment by strategically minimising the need for deforestation and, as a result, saving the forest cover.<br><br>
                        PM GatiShakti NMP  is already <span id="color_txt">being extensively used</span> across the country to optimise planning and implementation of large infrastructure projects. These are discussed and refined in Network Planning Group (NPG) meetings with the relevant Ministries/Departments, thus streamlining coordination across agencies.
                        In this compendium, we will bring to light <span id="color_txt">eight exemplary use cases</span> showcasing adoption and benefits of PM GatiShakti across the country.
