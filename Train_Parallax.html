                        The proposed rail alignment is between Bhadrak, a picturesque tourist attraction district in Odisha, and Vizianagaram, a historical city in Southern India, which have today emerged into modern commercial zones. 
                        Odisha is home to the country's second-largest coal reserves, with high demand in India across some Southern 
                        States and for exports.The rail alignment would reduce congestion in the existing burdened railway and port network and ease freight movement, providing an alternate route for coal and other minerals such as iron ore and steel from the ports to the domestic and global markets. The project is crucial for the movement of raw materials and cargo between India's southern and eastern coasts.

                        It would provide faster raw material access to steel plants, ensuring they have the materials neededfor
                        their expansion plans. It would help in seamless transportation from goods sheds and increase domestic 
                        coal transport and coastal connectivity. This, in turn, would reduce logistics transportation costs. 
                        Beyond connectivity between major east coast ports, the proposed broad gauge railway line will also 
                        connect major cities in Bhadrak, Odisha, and Vizianagaram, Andhra Pradesh.It will enable seamless
                        cargo movement between India's eastern and southern coast through rail-sea-rail movement.
                        It will catalyse the progress and development of the region while bringing seamless connectivity.

                        At the initiation of this project, the Railway Ministry was aware that the existing railway line had reached its maximum capacity despite the need for enhanced connectivity.

                            Two prominent challenges presented themselves: the burgeoning congestion at the nearby Paradeep port and the surplus production at the coal mines and steel plants, necessitating transportation to regions of high demand. Unfortunately, the current route from Paradeep could not accommodate this augmented freight.
                            It was at this point that the Railway Ministry turned to GatiShakti with a definitive directive:

                        to establish a third railway line within the corridor, strategically designed to bridge these gaps.<br><br>
                        The first and last-mile connectivity to these economic nodes was mapped on the NMP platform, and the infrastructure was planned by superimposing their alignment on the GIS maps on the platform. This comprehensive approach succeeded in augmenting connectivity across vital economic hubs, encompassing both major and minor ports. The approach maximises multimodality for seamless operations, creating a ripple effect with the industries and mines that use the materials transported.

                        Two prominent challenges presented themselves: the burgeoning congestion at the nearby Paradeep port and the surplus production at the coal mines and steel plants, necessitating transportation to regions of high demand. Unfortunately, the current route from Paradeep could not accommodate this augmented freight. It was at this point that the Railway Ministry turned to GatiShakti with a definitive directive: to establish a third railway line within the

                        The first and last-mile connectivity to these economic nodes was mapped on the NMP platform, and the infrastructure was planned by superimposing their alignment on the GIS maps on the platform.<br><br> This comprehensive approach succeeded in augmenting connectivity across vital economic hubs, encompassing both major and minor ports. The approach maximises multimodality for seamless operations, creating a ripple effect with the industries and mines that use the materials transported.

                <p>
                    The line will ease the congestion on the Howrah-Chennai main line, which sees increased freight traffic due to the demand for coal and other minerals being transported to Paradeep, Dhamra, and Visakhapatnam ports. It will benefit the coal handling and export from Paradeep Port from Talcher mines.
Both ends of the project area have a triple line section, which will improve the utilisation of the existing rail network. This line is crucial for the evacuation of cargo from upcoming ports like Bhavanpadu and Astaranga. As the steel industries of Kalinganagar expand, the line will also supplement raw material movement from various ports to steel plants.<br><br>
Availability of rolling stock will be improved on account of saving in detention. The project benefits the Shipping Ministry as it will improve the eastern coast's (Paradeep and Gopalpur port) transportation and will shift road-bound movement to rail.
The upcoming Kalinganagar industrial base, Talcher coalfields, Balasore industrial area, and major steel and iron ore industries near Paradeep will benefit.

Improved connectivity to these ports will reduce transportation costs and enable faster delivery of goods, thereby making them more competitive in the global market.
