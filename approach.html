This section details out the specifics of the GatiShakti approach which enables this holistic development.

                    Seven infrastructural engines propel the economic and social growth and progress of our country. These include railways, roads, ports, waterways, airports, mass transport, and logistics infrastructure.
                    PM GatiShakti is engineering a game-changing, technology-led innovation to bring together these engines for a collective and seamless impact.

                        PM GatiShakti is based on the six core principles outlined below to simplify the entire journey from planning to implementation. From an integrated development approach to planning connectivity, it looks at incorporating allied infrastructure such as laying utilities during the planning phase, enhancing additional connectivity to help seamless movement, ensuring ecological focus on conservation of forests, rivers, etc., and faster land acquisition and expedited clearances.

                     <span>
                        The outcomes planned through PM GatiShakti are made possible by focusing on each aspect of a project in granularity. The platform provides a comprehensive view of all projects on one platform, with visibility across stakeholders. This also helps drive faster prioritisation across Ministries and easier synchronisation to avoid delays. The detailed analysis from the data layer and the tools ensure better optimisation of projects and, through it all, keeps the process dynamic to ensure quick interventions for closure.

                        The sheer scale of infrastructural requirements in India is humungous. And that requires collaboration at multiple levels.<br> <br>

                       <b>Collaborative by design: GatiShaktiâ€™s whole-of-government approach</b><br>
                        The collaborative nature of GatiShakti starts right from the design. 8 Infrastructure Ministries, 14 Social Sector Ministries, 16 Economic Ministries, and 36 State and Union Territories have mapped GIS data layers of their individual Ministries/States/UTs, respectively, onto the National Master Plan.

                     <span>
                        These layers of information have enabled the platform to become a trusted repository by bringing together 60+ Central and State portals onto one platform with 1,463 data layers integrated.
                        Using the 50+ planning tools on the National Master Plan and the clearance & approval mechanisms the  inter-Ministerial issues resolution has been streamlined significantly. Additionally, comprehensive institutional mechanisms have been established at both federal and state levels to sustain this progress.

                        <b>From design to implementation: The Role of the Network Planning Group (NPG)</b><br>
                        To ensure that projects are completed on time, the road from idea to implementation is paved with the synchronisation in NPG. 
                        The NPG has been established under PM GatiShakti with the objective of facilitating the often-complex strategic planning and decision-making processes that underpin network infrastructure development. This brings a systemic change in ways inter-Ministerial collaborations can happen at scale and across projects.
                        The ongoing NPG meetings allow for efficiency in the integrated planning and decision-making process. To date, 100+ projects have been evaluated by the NPG, and over 156 first and last-mile connectivity projects have been identified. Additionally, 192 Energy Corridor projects of Ministry of Railways (MOR) have also been appraised by the NPG.<br><br>
                        
                        
                        <b>Leveraging Innovative Technology</b><br>
                        The National Master Plan leverages state-of-the-art geospatial technology, utilizing a dynamic Geographic Information System (GIS) and a satellite imagery-based platform developed by the

                        and a satellite imagery-based platform developed by the Bhaskaracharya National Institute for Space Applications and Geoinformatics (BISAG-N).
                        The technology has revolutionised data input, access, and accuracy. It has multiple specific modules to monitor projects, create queries, provide approvals, plan connectivity, look at overlaps and more.
                        The data on specific action plans of all Ministries/Departments are uploaded onto this one database that enables a dynamic mapping of all the infrastructure projects, along with real-time updates. This helps create a uniformity of source information everyone can access and use. This needs authentication and regular updating of datasets by Ministries/ Departments/ States and UTs becomes crucial. Thus, a Data Quality Improvement Plan has been formulated to ensure standardisation of layers, attributes, symbology, metadata for these data layers being uploaded.
                        For example, ministries like Ministries of Ports, Shipping & Waterways (PSW), Health and Family Welfare (HFW), Sports & Youth Affairs have common data layers shared between Ministries, States and UTs.
                        
                        Thus, SoPs consisting of six aspects have been ratified by NPG (Network Planning Group) for ensuring quality of data.

                The database has information on all current and ongoing projects across Ministries. The comprehensive platform enables easier collaboration across Departments, dramatically simplifying the planning process while ensuring a design that is mindful of all economic and social aspects.
                The Ministries and the State Departments are provided access so that the data can be updated periodically using application programming interfaces (APIs), and the integrated data can be reviewed as well.
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                As a way forward, multiple improvements have been planned to expand the capabilities of the technology platform and adoption across the country.<br><br> A vision of â€˜Area Development Approachâ€™ has been conceptualised to create adequate infrastructure catalysing socio-economic development in a sustainable manner within a rational geographical location through convergence. Major areas of planning may include aspects of physical Infrastructure like roads, economic analysis, social infrastructure like hospitals, agriculture and allied activities, natural resources, tourism, etc using institutionalised governance systems at State / District / local levels.
                
                Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) is planned to be integrated with GIS to enable recognition and labelling of objects, extraction of features, route optimisations etc. Integration with Natural Language Processing (NLP) could also enable users to interact with GIS using natural language.<br><br> Chat-Guided Planning, a new method of urban planning has been recently gaining traction amongst urban planners could be integrated too.
                
                Finally, given the scale and diversity of the country, a phased adoption of the technology platform is crucial in the future. Government bodies across the 740+ districts of India such as district administration, municipal corporations, urban local bodies etc., are planned to be onboarded to leverage the platform to efficiently plan and execute projects
                
                By taking us seamlessly across the railway lines to the expressway and from the airport to the waterways, through the green corridors and to the last mile of progress - this GatiShakti-led approach to development invites the world on an interconnected journey to the shared future.
                
                Let us drill down into each of these individual use cases.
