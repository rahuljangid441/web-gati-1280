                        The Government of India is developing various industrial corridor projects as part of the National Industrial Corridor Programme aimed at developing futuristic industrial cities in India that can compete with the best manufacturing and investment destinations in the world. This is part of the 32 nodes being built across 11 corridors in 4 phases. The projects are envisioned to create both employment opportunities and economic growth, leading to overall socio-economic development.<br><br>
                        
                        Planned to support this need, the Dholera Special Investment Region (DSIR) with the Dholera Industrial City (located 100 km (62.1 miles) south-west of Ahmedabad), has the distinction of being the first "Platinum" rated Greenfield Smart City. It has been benchmarked against the best in the world.It impacts multiple sectors, from Aerospace and Defence, Automobiles and Ancillary, Renewable Energy Equipment,

                        A plug-and-play approach has been planned where all land parcels are enabled with information, communication and technology (ICT).
                        The built-up infrastructure is offered at plot level to bring ease of living and business. It also provides an efficient and integrated way of managing logistics, operations and administration.<br><br>
                        The land aggregated for infrastructure is used for roads, physical infrastructure, social infrastructure, and other facilities and amenities. The land that will be used for common infrastructure is known as 'public purpose' land. Implementation of six town planning schemes is planned to be completed in phases. The first phase of the project, which is 22.54 sq. Km. (8.7 sq. miles) in area, has land for industrial, residential, commercial and social purposes.

            <h1>THE GATISHAKTI EDGE AND APPROACH</h1>
            <span>The PM GatiShakti enabled a comprehensive approach for greenfield area development. The NMP platform facilitated the assessment and analysis of the existing infrastructure and forecasting the demand for the future infrastructure requirements.<br><br>
                This encompassed evaluating the existing regional infrastructure and leveraging support to gain alignment and approvals from other ministries, covering aspects such as roads, airports, sewer lines, and telephone networks. <br><br>
                Using PM GatiShakti NMP, the Bhimnath Dholera Rail link project was planned, aiming to establish connectivity with the Western Dedicated Freight Corridor (WDFC), linking ports like Mundra, Kandla, and Pipavav to the hinterland areas. The NMP also facilitated meticulous planning for the initial phase of the Dholera project, covering 22.5 sq km (8.7 sq miles), resulting in significant reductions in travel distances for roads (compared to a previous 1 km route) and airport access (20 km compared to over 50 km previously).<br><br>

                Moreover, in order to meet the growth demands, allied infrastructure is being built by the proposed Ministries, including gas, power, sewage, stormwater, portable, and recycled water, has all been planned along with social infrastructure components like gas stations, electric vehicle charging stations, educational institutions, skill development centres, leisure areas, and public amenities.<br><br>
                The platform has streamlined clearance procedures and reduced complexity in proposals for setting up new establishments. With a focus on sustainability and adherence to wastewater treatment requirements, the design seeks to achieve zero waste discharge. Best-in-class systems are integrated for managing biodegradable waste, harnessing renewable energy, and promoting 

                water reuse. Green spaces and parks have been thoughtfully planned to foster a sustainable community that harmoniously combines living, working, and recreational aspects.<br><br>
                 The National Master Plan has also facilitated town planning schemes, ensuring the provision of serviced land that benefits both the local population and the private sector. Under this framework, 50% of individual land holdings are pooled for physical and social infrastructure, while the remaining 50% is developed into serviced land and returned to the landowners.

                        At the initiation of this project, the Railway Ministry was aware that the existing railway line had reached its maximum capacity despite the need for enhanced connectivity.

                            Two prominent challenges presented themselves: the burgeoning congestion at the nearby Paradeep port and the surplus production at the coal mines and steel plants, necessitating transportation to regions of high demand. Unfortunately, the current route from Paradeep could not accommodate this augmented freight.
                            It was at this point that the Railway Ministry turned to GatiShakti with a definitive directive:

                        to establish a third railway line within the corridor, strategically designed to bridge these gaps.<br>
                        The first and last-mile connectivity to these economic nodes was mapped on the NMP platform, and the infrastructure was planned by superimposing their alignment on the GIS maps on the platform . This comprehensive approach succeeded in augmenting connectivity across vital economic hubs, encompassing both major and minor ports. The approach maximises multimodality for seamless operations, creating a ripple effect with the industries and mines that use the materials transported.

                <p>
                    In addition to its exceptional multimodal and sustainable development, Dholera is seamlessly connected to the global network through several external access points.
 
                    These encompass a cutting-edge 6-lane expressway under construction by the National Highways Authority of India, facilitating direct connection between Ahmedabad and Dholera. Simultaneously, the airport overseen by the Airports Authority of India, is being established.
                     
                    The Greenfield International Airport at Dholera is intended to improve air connectivity throughout the region while reducing congestion at the current Ahmedabad airport. Furthermore, the Bhimnath Dholera Rail link project's ultimate connectivity plan integrates with freight corridors and ports, simplifying the movement of goods.
                     
                    With its ambitious vision, characterised by both economic and social equilibrium and uncompromising quality of life, this venture is set to emerge as an appealing hub for both domestic and international enterprises. The development boasts cutting-edge infrastructure and world-class amenities, solidifying its status as a premier destination.
